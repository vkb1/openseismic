About Open Seismic
------------------

Open Seismic is an open source toolbox for conducting inference on seismic data using `OpenVINO <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html>`_.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before building the docker image or installing locally, we need to download some datasets.


You need to install ``gdown`` to use the automated downloading script.

.. code-block::
   
   $ pip3 install gdown==3.12.2

To download the required data to the proper directory, run ``setup_dependencies.sh``:

.. code-block::
   
   $ ./setup_dependencies.sh

Lastly, set up a Python virtual environment and install required dependencies using ``requirements.txt``:

.. code-block::
   
   $ python3 -m venv open_seismic
   $ source open_seismic/bin/activate
   (open_seismic)$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt

Docker
^^^^^^

The following command builds the docker image. This is the recommended way of installing Open Seismic and will be the default way that this README interacts with Open Seismic.

.. code-block::

   $ docker build . -t open_seismic

**Note:** If you have a proxy, build the docker container using the command below:

.. code-block::
   
   $ docker build --build-arg http_proxy=http://my-proxy:port --build-arg https_proxy=http://my-proxy:port . -t open_seismic 

If you want to stop a container by name, run:

.. code-block::
   
   $ docker stop <container_name>

You can find the ``<container_name>`` using the command:

.. code-block::
   
   $ docker ps

Next Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would like to learn more about Open Seismic, please go to our documentation website. If you would like a more interactive learning experience, please go to the ``examples/`` directory and follow the instructions in the notebooks. If you would like to learn more about models that exist within Open Seismic, please go to ``app/`` and look in each folder dedicated to demo-ing a model.

In the ``examples/`` directory, you will find four notebooks:

#. ``Example1.ipynb``: This notebook will teach you about converting models to OpenVINO IR.
#. ``Example2.ipynb``: This notebook will go over how to define custom preprocessing, postprocessing, and model inference handling scripts.
#. ``Example3.ipynb``: This notebook will walkthrough how to use Open Seismic by using an example JSON config file.
#. ``Example4.ipynb``: This notebook allows users to rapidly get started with using Open Seismic by editing a couple of variables in the notebook.

In the ``demos/`` directory, you will find three demo notebooks. Each notebook goes over how to utilize the given models in Open Seismic.

Local
^^^^^
Users can also choose to locally install Open Seismic outside of a Docker container. This option is **not recommended**.

#. Install Intel's Distribution of OpenVINO. The required version of OpenVINO is **2020.4.287**. Documentation for installation can be found `here <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html>`_.
#. Execute the following commands in a terminal window:
   .. code-block::

      $ python3 -m venv open_seismic
      $ source open_seismic/bin/activate
      (open_seismic)$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt


Details for Usage
-----------------

A user needs to provide the following files:

#. Dataset
#. JSON Config

A user can also provide these files for custom processing:

#. OpenVINO Model Initializer, XML, and BIN file
#. Preprocessor Script
#. Postprocessor Script

If an OpenVINO model is not provided, then please choose from a list of given models:

#. FaultSeg
#. Salt
#. Facies

The preprocessing script and postprocessing script are for your benefit, as we provide a way for you to customize inference depending on the filetype of your dataset. If you are using a given model, then check that your dataset filetype is supported by the model.

For datasets with variable shape, expect a slight degredation in performance due to reshaping of the network. For best performance, adhere to a static shape dataset. Async tasks :raw-html-m2r:`<b>do not allow</b>` variable shape.

JSON Config Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    {
    /*

    The script.sh file can be used as a conduit for specifying Python scripts. Use

        },

    /*

    }

Refer to `here <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model_General.html>`_ for information on model optimizer parameters.

Preprocessor, Postprocessor, and Model Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preprocessor script should be stored in a folder dedicated to scripts. However, if you have more files that you need to mount, follow the recommended mount directory structure outlined in the next section. In the preprocess script, it must include the function below:

.. code-block::

    def preprocess(data, input_layers, input_shape=(...), model=None):
        ...
        return {input_layer_1: data_1, ..., input_layer_n: data_n}

The same can be said of the postprocessor script, if you choose to define one. It must include the function below:

.. code-block::

   def postprocess(output_dict, output_shape=(...)):
       ...
       return {output_layer_1: data_1, ..., output_layer_n: data_n}

Lastly, users can define a custom model class to handle custom inference. The model script must include a ``model`` class. More details for all three scripts can be found in ``examples/Example2.ipynb``.

File Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following file structure is recommended for two reasons:


#. Clear encapsulation of custom scripts and data
#. Easy mounting to docker container. You only need to mount one volume/directory in order to access both the data folder and the custom model script folder.

.. code-block::

    my_local_dir/
        config.json
        my_data_folder\
            ...
            data_file_i
            ...
        my_optimization_folder\
            converter_script.sh
            converter_script_helper.py
        my_scripts_folder\
            model.py
            preprocessor.py
            postprocessor.py
            modelname.xml
            modelname.bin
            modelname.mapping

Model Optimizer
---------------

Example:

.. code-block::

   $ docker run -v /abs/path/to/mnt/:/path/to/mnt/ open_seismic /bin/bash executables/mo.sh -h

Command above is the help tab, which will give you the arguments that you will need to optimize a mounted model.

Inference
---------

General Purpose Example (Handling model conversion, optimization, and inference):

.. code-block::

   $ docker run –v /path/to/vol/:/core/vol/ –v /path/to/runs/:/core/runs/ -v /path/to/models/:/core/python/models/ open_seismic /bin/bash ./run.sh "–c /path/to/config.json"

Note above that the file paths in the script options must be from root of the docker container: "/". Recommended file structure is introduced in the later part of the README. There are at least two mounts that we must do:

#. Mounting the necessary files for inference
#. Mounting a directory for capturing output
#. Mounting Open Seismic models

This is shown in the example above. For a more interactive experience, please go to the example notebooks in ``examples``.

Visualization
--------------

An example of how to use our visualizer is featured below:

.. code-block::

   $ ./core/executables/visualize.sh --input fseg_output --output visualization --model_type fault --slice_no 100

Output visualized images will be saved to ``path/to/runs/latest_data_folder/visualization``.

**Note:** Since ``visualize.sh`` works with the last inference, please make sure its type is the same as the visualization type. Also, you must install the Python dependencies outlined in ``requirements.txt``.
